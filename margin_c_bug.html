    Margin collapsing is a behavior in CSS where the margins of adjacent
    elements (like boxes) can sometimes combine to form a larger margin.
    <br />
    Or in this case two paragraphs are nested in one <em>div</em> element.
    <br />These two have <code>1rem</code> vertical margin between one
    another, yet their margin is combined inside their parent margin. This can
    be solved if we apply min-max margin limitations.

  <p>The bottom margin of this paragraph is collapsed</p>
    <p>
      and is combined with this paragraph's top margin.
    </p>

    <div>
      Div parent element has another two paragraphs
      <p>These are two contents inside their parent (div) <sup>1</sup></p>
      <p>These are two contents inside their parent (div) <sup>2</sup></p>
    </div>
