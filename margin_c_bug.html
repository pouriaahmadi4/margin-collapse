    Margin collapsing is a behavior in CSS where the margins of adjacent
    elements (like boxes) can sometimes combine to form a larger margin.
    <br />
    Or in this case two paragraphs are nested in one <em>div</em> element.
    <br />These two have <code>1rem</code> vertical margin between one
    another, yet their margin is combined inside their parent margin. This can
    be solved if we apply min-max margin limitations.
